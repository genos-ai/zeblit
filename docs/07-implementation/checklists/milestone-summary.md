- [ ] Client tests

#### 5.2 Documentation 📚
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Architecture diagrams
- [ ] User guides
- [ ] Deployment guide

## 🚦 Quick Status Check

### Ready to Start Now:
1. OrbStack client implementation
2. Console capture service
3. Agent orchestrator

### Blocked Until Container Integration:
- Command execution
- File synchronization
- Live preview

### Can Be Done in Parallel:
- API key service
- WebSocket manager
- Database migrations

## 📝 Key Decisions Made:

1. **API**: REST + WebSockets
2. **Auth**: API Keys + JWT
3. **Telegram**: Polling (not webhooks)
4. **Chat**: Dev Manager is primary interface
5. **Files**: Upload/Download API only
6. **Execution**: Backend containers only
7. **Priority**: CLI → Telegram → Web
8. **Start**: Core backend APIs first

## 🎯 Success Criteria:

- [ ] Backend fully functional without any UI
- [ ] All business logic in backend
- [ ] Clients are thin presentation layers
- [ ] Same API for all client types
- [ ] Real-time updates working
- [ ] Container execution working
- [ ] Console capture working
- [ ] Agents responding to chats

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. Start with `OrbStackClient` implementation
2. In parallel, work on `ConsoleService`
3. Once containers work, connect file operations
4. Then connect agents to real LLM calls
5. Finally, build CLI client as proof of concept
