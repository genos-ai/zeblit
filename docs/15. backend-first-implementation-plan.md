# Zeblit Backend-First Implementation Plan

*Version: 2.0.0*
*Author: Zeblit Development Team*
*Last Updated: 2025-01-11*

## Changelog
- 2.0.0 (2025-01-11): **MAJOR MILESTONE** - Production-ready backend with complete task scheduling, stability fixes, and OpenAI compatibility
- 1.0.0 (2025-01-11): Initial implementation plan created

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for completing the Zeblit AI Development Platform with a backend-first approach. The backend will serve as the single source of truth with all business logic, while clients (CLI, Telegram, Web) remain thin presentation layers.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Backend-First Design
- **ALL business logic** lives in the backend
- Clients are purely presentation layers
- Single unified API serves all client types
- No client-specific endpoints or logic

### 2. API Design
- **REST API** for CRUD operations
- **WebSockets** for real-time updates
- **JSON** as the standard data format
- **JWT + API Keys** for authentication

### 3. Execution Model
- **ALL code execution** happens in backend containers
- Clients never execute user code locally
- Output streaming via WebSockets
- File operations through upload/download API

## Migration Strategy

### From Current State:
1. Complete backend APIs without breaking existing web UI
2. Add versioning to all endpoints
3. Gradually migrate web UI to use new APIs
4. Deprecate old endpoints after all clients migrated

### Database Migrations:
- Add API keys table
- Add scheduled tasks table
- Add telegram_links table
- Update container model for new features

## Security Considerations

1. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting per API key
   - Request signing for sensitive operations
   - Audit logging for all actions
   - Encrypted storage for secrets

2. **Container Security**
   - Network isolation
   - Resource limits
   - No privileged operations
   - Read-only root filesystem

3. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit (TLS)
   - User data isolation
   - Regular security audits

## Conclusion

This backend-first approach ensures:
- Single source of truth for all business logic
- Easy addition of new client types
- Consistent behavior across all clients
- Simplified maintenance and updates
- Better security and control

The implementation focuses on completing the backend API layer first, making it fully functional before adding any new clients. This ensures that whether users prefer CLI, Telegram, or Web interfaces, they get the same powerful Zeblit experience.
