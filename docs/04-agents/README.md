zeblit chat "I need to build a todo application with user authentication"

# The Development Manager will:
# 1. Analyze requirements with Product Manager
# 2. Design architecture with System Architect  
# 3. Plan implementation with Senior Engineer
# 4. Setup infrastructure with Platform Engineer
# 5. Ensure security with Security Engineer
# 6. Design data layer with Data Analyst
```

### **Agent-Specific Commands**
```bash
# Direct agent interaction
zeblit chat --agent=product-manager "Create user stories for a blog platform"
zeblit chat --agent=architect "Design a microservices architecture for e-commerce"
zeblit chat --agent=security-engineer "Perform security assessment of the API"

# Multi-agent collaboration
zeblit chat "Build a secure, scalable chat application with real-time features"
```

### **Agent Status and Monitoring**
```bash
# Check agent availability
zeblit agents status

# View agent capabilities
zeblit agents list --detailed
