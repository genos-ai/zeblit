# AI Development Platform - Cursor Project Status

## Overall Progress: ~55%

### 🎯 Current Focus
- **Phase**: 3 - AI Agent System (40% Complete)
- **Task**: Implementing specialized agents (Senior Engineer next)
- **Priority**: Complete the remaining 3 specialized AI agents

### ✅ Completed in Phase 3

1. **LLM Integration** ✅
   - Comprehensive provider interface with Anthropic Claude
   - Streaming, retry logic, cost tracking
   - Factory pattern for provider management

2. **Base Agent Framework** ✅
   - Abstract base class for all agents
   - State management with Redis broadcasting
   - Inter-agent collaboration support
   - Task progress tracking

3. **Development Manager Agent** ✅
   - Complete task orchestration and planning
   - Intelligent task breakdown and assignment
   - Dependency tracking and execution ordering
   - Status reporting and coordination

4. **Product Manager Agent** ✅
   - User story generation with acceptance criteria
   - UI/UX design with wireframe descriptions
   - Feature prioritization (MoSCoW method)
   - Requirements validation and review
   - User persona creation

5. **Data Analyst Agent** ✅
   - Database schema design with normalization
   - SQL script generation (CREATE, INDEX, etc.)
   - Query optimization recommendations
   - ETL pipeline design
   - Analytics solution architecture
   - Comprehensive documentation generation

### 📊 Phase Status

#### Phase 0-2: Complete ✅ (100%)
- Foundation, Backend Core, Container Management

#### Phase 3: AI Agent System 🚧 (40%)
- **Complete**: LLM, Base Framework, Dev Manager, Product Manager, Data Analyst
- **Next**: Senior Engineer Agent
- **Remaining**: Engineer, Architect, Platform Engineer, orchestration, cost tracking

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement Senior Engineer Agent**
   - Code generation with best practices
   - Testing implementation
   - Debugging and error handling
   - Code review and refactoring

2. **Create Remaining Agents**:
   - Architect (system design, patterns)
   - Platform Engineer (DevOps, deployment)

3. **Build Agent Orchestration**:
   - Task queue with Celery
   - Workflow engine
   - Cost tracking system

### 💡 Agent Capabilities Summary

#### Development Manager
- **Planning**: Breaks down requirements into specific tasks
- **Assignment**: Routes tasks to appropriate agents
- **Coordination**: Manages dependencies and conflicts
- **Reporting**: Generates project status reports

#### Product Manager
- **User Stories**: Creates detailed stories with acceptance criteria
- **Design**: Produces UI/UX wireframes and flows
- **Prioritization**: Uses MoSCoW method for features
- **Validation**: Reviews implementations against requirements

#### Data Analyst
- **Schema Design**: Creates normalized database schemas
- **SQL Generation**: Produces CREATE TABLE, INDEX, etc.
- **Optimization**: Analyzes and improves query performance
- **Documentation**: Generates comprehensive schema docs

### 📝 Example: Agent Collaboration

```python
# Dev Manager creates tasks
planning_task = Task(
    type=TaskType.PLANNING,
    title="Build user authentication",
    description="JWT-based auth with roles"
)

# Dev Manager breaks it down and assigns:
# - PM: Create user stories and UI design
# - Data Analyst: Design user/role schema
# - Engineer: Implement auth logic
# - Architect: Design auth architecture
```

### 🎨 Architecture Patterns

1. **Structured Output**: Agents use JSON for structured responses
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with MVP, then iterate
3. **Documentation First**: Every agent produces documentation
4. **Real-time Updates**: All progress broadcast via Redis
5. **Cost Awareness**: Complex model use tracked and optimized

### 🔗 Key Files Added
- `src/backend/agents/product_manager.py` - PM agent implementation
- `src/backend/agents/data_analyst.py` - Data Analyst implementation
- Updated factory and exports for new agents
