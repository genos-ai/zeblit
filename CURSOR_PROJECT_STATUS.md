# Cursor Project Status - AI Development Platform

## Current Phase: Phase 3 Complete - Ready for Phase 4 (Git Integration)

### Overall Progress: ~80%

## Recently Completed (Phase 3 - AI Agent System)

### ✅ Agent Orchestration System
1. **Celery Task Queue**
   - Created `src/backend/core/celery_app.py` with Redis broker
   - Configured task routing for agents, orchestration, and cost tracking
   - Set up periodic tasks for cleanup and cost aggregation

2. **Agent Tasks**
   - Created `src/backend/tasks/agent_tasks.py`
   - Implemented `process_agent_task` for individual agent execution
   - Added `agent_collaborate` for inter-agent communication
   - Created `batch_process_tasks` for parallel execution

3. **Orchestration Tasks**
   - Created `src/backend/tasks/orchestration_tasks.py`
   - Implemented `create_development_workflow` for full development cycles
   - Added workflow chaining with Celery chain/group/chord
   - Created task dependency management

4. **Cost Tracking Tasks**
   - Created `src/backend/tasks/cost_tracking_tasks.py`
   - Implemented usage recording with `record_llm_usage`
   - Added daily cost aggregation
   - Created monthly limit checking with email alerts
   - Built usage report generation

5. **Orchestration Service & API**
   - Created `src/backend/services/orchestration.py`
   - Added API endpoints in `src/backend/api/v1/endpoints/orchestration.py`
   - Created schemas in `src/backend/schemas/orchestration.py`
   - Endpoints include:
     - POST /orchestration/workflows - Start development workflow
     - POST /orchestration/task-chains - Create task chains
     - GET /orchestration/workflows/{id}/status - Check workflow status
     - POST /orchestration/workflows/{id}/cancel - Cancel workflow
     - GET /orchestration/agents/workload - Get agent workloads
     - POST /orchestration/tasks/{id}/retry - Retry failed tasks

### Phase 3 Summary
- ✅ All 6 AI agents fully implemented
- ✅ LLM integration with Anthropic Claude
- ✅ Agent orchestration with Celery
- ✅ Cost tracking and usage limits
- ✅ Multi-agent workflows
- ✅ Task dependency management
- ✅ Parallel and sequential execution

## Next Steps: Phase 4 - Git Integration

### 1. Git Service Implementation
- Create Git client wrapper
- Implement repository initialization
- Add branch management (create, switch, merge, delete)
- Implement commit operations
- Add file staging
- Create diff generation
- Implement conflict detection
- Add merge strategies

### 2. Agent Git Workflow
- Create agent branch naming convention
- Implement agent commit messages
- Add automatic branch creation
- Create merge request system
- Implement conflict resolution
- Add code review workflow
- Create rollback mechanism

### 3. Git API Endpoints
- GET /api/projects/{id}/git/status
- GET /api/projects/{id}/git/branches
- POST /api/projects/{id}/git/branches
- POST /api/projects/{id}/git/commit
- POST /api/projects/{id}/git/merge
- GET /api/projects/{id}/git/diff
- GET /api/projects/{id}/git/log

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Complete AI agent system with 6 specialized agents
- ✅ Celery-based task orchestration
- ✅ Cost tracking with usage limits
- ✅ 50+ API endpoints
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket communication
- ✅ Container management with OrbStack
- ✅ File system management
- ✅ Console capture system

## Technical Debt & Improvements
1. Add comprehensive tests for agent system
2. Implement agent performance metrics
3. Add workflow templates for common patterns
4. Create agent training/fine-tuning system
5. Add more LLM providers (OpenAI, Google)

## Dependencies to Install
```bash
# Already added to requirements.txt:
- celery
- celery[redis]
- flower (Celery monitoring)
- anthropic (Claude API)
```

## Environment Variables Needed
```bash
# Already in env.example:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here  # For future fallback
```

## Running Celery Workers
```bash
# Start Celery worker (from project root)
celery -A src.backend.core.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

# Start Celery beat for periodic tasks
celery -A src.backend.core.celery_app beat --loglevel=info

# Monitor with Flower
celery -A src.backend.core.celery_app flower
```

## Testing the Agent System
1. Create a project
2. Start a development workflow:
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/orchestration/workflows
   {
     "project_id": "...",
     "requirements": "Build a todo app with React"
   }
   ```
3. Monitor workflow status
4. Check agent outputs in tasks

## Notes for Next Developer
- Agent system is fully functional but needs extensive testing
- Cost tracking is implemented but needs production testing
- Celery workers must be running for agent tasks to execute
- Redis must be running for task queue and pub/sub
- Check logs in /logs directory for debugging
