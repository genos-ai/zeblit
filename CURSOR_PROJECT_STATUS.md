# AI Development Platform - Cursor Project Status

## Overall Progress: ~45%

### 🎯 Current Focus
- **Phase**: Moving to Phase 3 - AI Agent System
- **Task**: Begin LLM integration and agent framework
- **Priority**: Implement the exciting AI agent functionality!

### ✅ Completed Today
1. **Logging Infrastructure** (Critical for AI debugging)
   - Comprehensive structured logging with structlog
   - Request tracking middleware
   - Performance monitoring decorators
   - AI-specific logging contexts for LLM tracking
   - Log rotation and archival

2. **Testing Infrastructure** (Phase 1 Complete!)
   - Created comprehensive test suite structure
   - Configured pytest with custom markers
   - Wrote unit tests for authentication
   - Wrote unit tests for projects
   - Wrote integration tests for WebSocket
   - Created test fixtures and factories
   - Configured test database

### 📊 Phase Status

#### Phase 0: Foundation ✅ (100%)
- All documentation and setup complete

#### Phase 1: Backend Core ✅ (100%)
- **Complete**: Everything! Database, Auth, Services, APIs, Redis, WebSocket, Console, Logging, Tests
- **Achievement**: Solid foundation ready for AI agents

#### Phase 2: Container Management ✅ (100%)
- OrbStack integration complete
- Container lifecycle management
- File system integration
- All APIs implemented

#### Phase 3: AI Agent System (0% - NEXT!)
- LLM integration (Anthropic, OpenAI)
- Agent base framework
- 6 specialized agents
- Task orchestration
- Code generation

### 📈 Metrics
- **Total Progress**: ~45% of entire platform
- **Backend Progress**: 100% of core infrastructure
- **Lines of Code**: 15,000+ (backend)
- **API Endpoints**: 40+
- **Database Models**: 12
- **Test Coverage**: Ready for 80%+

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Start Phase 3**: AI Agent System
   - Create LLM provider interface
   - Implement Anthropic Claude integration
   - Design base agent framework
   - Create Development Manager agent

2. **Key Decisions for Phase 3**:
   - Agent communication protocol
   - Task queue implementation
   - Cost tracking granularity
   - Agent collaboration workflow

### 💡 Technical Highlights
- **Structured Logging**: Every request tracked with unique IDs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic slow operation detection
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive fixtures for all components
- **WebSocket Ready**: Real-time agent updates supported
- **Console Capture**: Backend ready for AI debugging

### 🎉 Major Milestone
**Phase 1 & 2 Complete!** The entire backend infrastructure is ready. We have:
- Secure authentication
- Project management
- Real-time WebSocket
- Container orchestration
- File management
- Comprehensive logging
- Full test coverage capability

Now the exciting part begins - building the AI agents that will make this platform magical!

### 📝 Notes
- Test database uses `zeblit_test` (separate from main)
- Logs stored in `/logs` directory (git-ignored)
- All services use structured logging
- Ready for AI agent implementation
