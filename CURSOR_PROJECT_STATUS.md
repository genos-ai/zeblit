# AI Development Platform - Cursor Project Status

## Overall Progress: ~50%

### 🎯 Current Focus
- **Phase**: 3 - AI Agent System (25% Complete)
- **Task**: Implementing specialized agents (Product Manager next)
- **Priority**: Create the remaining 5 specialized AI agents

### ✅ Completed in Phase 3
1. **LLM Integration** ✅
   - Created comprehensive LLM provider interface
   - Implemented Anthropic Claude provider with all 3 models
   - Added automatic retry logic and error handling
   - Implemented streaming support
   - Created factory pattern for easy provider switching
   - Added cost tracking and token counting

2. **Base Agent Framework** ✅
   - Created BaseAgent abstract class
   - Implemented agent state management
   - Added message history tracking
   - Created collaboration methods between agents
   - Implemented Redis broadcasting for real-time updates
   - Added task progress tracking
   - Created agent message persistence
   - Built agent factory for easy instantiation

3. **Development Manager Agent** ✅
   - Implemented complete task orchestration
   - Created sophisticated planning system that breaks down requirements
   - Built task assignment logic based on agent expertise
   - Added dependency tracking and execution ordering
   - Implemented coordination and review capabilities
   - Created comprehensive status reporting
   - Added progress tracking and broadcasting

### 📊 Phase Status

#### Phase 0: Foundation ✅ (100%)
- All documentation and setup complete

#### Phase 1: Backend Core ✅ (100%)
- Complete with logging and testing infrastructure

#### Phase 2: Container Management ✅ (100%)
- OrbStack integration complete
- File system with versioning

#### Phase 3: AI Agent System 🚧 (25%)
- **Complete**: LLM Integration, Base Framework, Development Manager
- **Next**: Product Manager Agent
- **Remaining**: 5 specialized agents, orchestration, cost tracking

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement Product Manager Agent**
   - User story generation
   - Requirements translation
   - UI/UX suggestions
   - Feature prioritization

2. **Create Remaining Agents** (in order):
   - Data Analyst
   - Senior Engineer
   - Architect
   - Platform Engineer

3. **Build Agent Orchestration**:
   - Task queue with Celery
   - Dependency resolution
   - Parallel execution
   - Workflow engine

### 💡 Key Achievements

#### Development Manager Features
- **Intelligent Planning**: Breaks down complex requirements into specific, actionable tasks
- **Smart Assignment**: Assigns tasks to appropriate agents based on expertise:
  - Product Manager: Requirements, UI/UX
  - Data Analyst: Database, analytics
  - Engineer: Implementation, testing
  - Architect: System design, patterns
  - Platform Engineer: DevOps, infrastructure
- **Dependency Management**: Tracks task dependencies and execution order
- **Real-time Updates**: Broadcasts progress via Redis for UI updates
- **Flexible Processing**: Handles planning, coordination, review, and guidance tasks

### 📝 Example: Using the Development Manager

```python
# Create a planning task
task = Task(
    project_id=project.id,
    type=TaskType.PLANNING,
    title="Build user authentication",
    description="Implement complete user auth with JWT"
)

# Process with Dev Manager
dev_manager = await AgentFactory.create_agent_by_type(
    AgentType.DEVELOPMENT_MANAGER,
    db_session,
    project_id=project.id
)

result = await dev_manager.process_task(task)
# Returns: Created subtasks for PM, Architect, Engineer, etc.
```

### 🎨 Architecture Insights

1. **Agent Autonomy**: Each agent can think independently using LLM
2. **Collaboration**: Agents can communicate through the base framework
3. **Task Hierarchy**: Parent tasks can spawn subtasks with dependencies
4. **Real-time Visibility**: All agent actions broadcast to frontend
5. **Cost Awareness**: Every LLM call tracked for budget management

### 🔗 Key Files Added/Modified

- `src/backend/agents/base.py` - Base agent framework
- `src/backend/agents/dev_manager.py` - Development Manager implementation
- `src/backend/agents/factory.py` - Agent instantiation factory
