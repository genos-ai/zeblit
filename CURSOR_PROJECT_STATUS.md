# AI Development Platform - Cursor Project Status

## Overall Progress: ~65%

### 🎯 Current Focus
- **Phase**: 3 - AI Agent System (75% Complete)
- **Task**: Agent Orchestration and Cost Tracking
- **Priority**: Complete the orchestration system to enable agent collaboration

### ✅ Completed in Phase 3

1. **LLM Integration** ✅
   - Comprehensive provider interface with Anthropic Claude
   - Streaming, retry logic, cost tracking
   - Factory pattern for provider management

2. **Base Agent Framework** ✅
   - Abstract base class for all agents
   - State management with Redis broadcasting
   - Inter-agent collaboration support
   - Task progress tracking

3. **All 6 Specialized Agents** ✅
   - **Development Manager**: Orchestrates tasks, assigns to agents
   - **Product Manager**: User stories, UI/UX design, prioritization
   - **Data Analyst**: Database schemas, SQL generation, optimization
   - **Senior Engineer**: Code implementation, testing, debugging
   - **Architect**: System design, patterns, scalability
   - **Platform Engineer**: DevOps, CI/CD, containerization

### 📊 Phase Status

#### Phase 0-2: Complete ✅ (100%)
- Foundation, Backend Core, Container Management

#### Phase 3: AI Agent System 🚧 (75%)
- **Complete**: LLM, Base Framework, All 6 Agents
- **Remaining**: Agent Orchestration, Cost Tracking

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Agent Orchestration System**
   - Task queue with Celery
   - Workflow engine for complex tasks
   - Dependency resolution
   - Parallel execution support

2. **Cost Tracking System**
   - Real-time token counting
   - Cost aggregation per project/user
   - Usage limits and alerts
   - Optimization recommendations

3. **Phase 4: Git Integration**
   - Git service implementation
   - Agent branch management
   - Automated merging

### 💡 Agent Capabilities Matrix

| Agent | Primary Role | Key Outputs |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Dev Manager** | Orchestration | Task breakdown, assignments, status reports |
| **Product Manager** | Requirements | User stories, wireframes, specifications |
| **Data Analyst** | Database | Schemas, SQL scripts, optimizations |
| **Engineer** | Implementation | Code files, tests, bug fixes |
| **Architect** | Design | Architecture diagrams, tech selection |
| **Platform Engineer** | Operations | Dockerfiles, K8s configs, CI/CD pipelines |

### 📝 Example: Full Agent Collaboration Flow

```python
# 1. User request: "Build a user authentication system"

# 2. Dev Manager breaks it down:
tasks = [
    {"agent": "PM", "task": "Create auth user stories"},
    {"agent": "Architect", "task": "Design auth architecture"},
    {"agent": "Data Analyst", "task": "Design user/session schema"},
    {"agent": "Engineer", "task": "Implement auth logic"},
    {"agent": "Platform Engineer", "task": "Setup auth monitoring"}
]

# 3. Each agent processes their task with structured output
# 4. Results flow back to Dev Manager for coordination
# 5. Final integrated solution delivered to user
```

### 🎨 Technical Achievements

1. **Structured Output**: All agents use JSON for parseable responses
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Engineer detects and generates appropriate code
3. **Complete Documentation**: Every agent produces comprehensive docs
4. **Cost Awareness**: Complex vs simple model selection based on task
5. **Real-time Updates**: All progress broadcast via Redis

### 🔧 Architecture Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Agent and LLM provider instantiation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different task handling per agent type
- **Observer Pattern**: Redis pub/sub for real-time updates
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer
- **Dependency Injection**: Flexible agent configuration

### 🔗 Key Files Completed
- `src/backend/agents/engineer.py` - Code implementation agent
- `src/backend/agents/architect.py` - System design agent
- `src/backend/agents/platform_engineer.py` - DevOps agent
- All agents registered in factory and exports

### 📈 What's Next After Orchestration

1. **Phase 4**: Git Integration (10%)
2. **Phase 5**: Frontend Development (30%)
3. **Phase 6**: Integration & Testing (10%)
4. **Phase 7**: DevOps & Deployment (5%)
5. **Phase 8**: Production Readiness (5%)
